I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki. I am a multidisciplinarian studying sustainable cultural evolution, collective behaviour change, and decision-making under uncertainty. I have a soft spot for complex systems and philosophy of science.

In my free time I am an amateur musician who loves nature, hiking, foraging, [photography](https://500px.com/roopekaaronen), and coffee. I also write popular science. I am always on the lookout for new ideas and inspirations, so please don't hesitate to contact me.
